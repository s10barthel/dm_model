# pc-xPass deceleration and cache versions

pc-xPass models each speed-grid value as the initial release speed. The ball slows
at `--ball-dec` metres per second squared (default `0.45`). Use `--ball-dec 0` for
constant-speed passes. The ball never reverses: sampled targets beyond its stopping
distance are excluded from scoring and ranking. Accessible Space is unchanged.

## Normal caches

```powershell
# Create a fresh version with an automatically generated ID.
python scripts/generate_physical_xpass.py --pc-xpass --ball-dec 0.45

# Create a named version, or resume it with its recorded settings.
python scripts/generate_physical_xpass.py --pc-xpass --pc-xpass-id dec045

# Explicitly select the version for inference.
python scripts/run_hawkeye.py --pc-xpass --pc-xpass-id dec045
```

Each version lives in `data/pc_xpass/<pc_xpass_id>/`, with root metadata and separate
`sportec`, `skillcorner`, `benchmark`, and `hawkeye` subdirectories. Dataset files
retain their existing layout. The command prints its generated ID.

Generation without an ID always creates a new version. Resuming an ID inherits
omitted generation settings and rejects explicitly conflicting settings. The
metadata records settings, physics/schema versions, invocation history, coverage,
and completion status. Compatible missing rows can be added to a version.

Normal consumers default to the ID in `data/pc_xpass/latest.json`. Successful
generation updates this global pointer; failed, incomplete, and dry runs do not.
A deliberately limited successful run can become latest. If it lacks your dataset,
select an appropriate ID explicitly; consumers do not search older versions.

`--pc-xpass-id` is also available for training with lane-survival features,
evaluation, EPV generation, and visualization. It selects a cache without enabling
additional model features. Outputs record the resolved ID for reproducibility.

## Hawkeye location and freeze caches

```powershell
# Always create a fresh location cache, independently of normal latest.
python scripts/run_hawkeye_loc.py --ball-dec 0.45

# Reuse an existing location cache; compute missing rows using its settings.
python scripts/run_hawkeye_loc.py --pc-xpass-id <location-cache-id>
```

These caches live in `data/pc_xpass/hawkeye_loc/<pc_xpass_id>/`. An explicit ID must
already exist. Cached generation settings override conflicting CLI flags with a
warning, including deceleration and metric-generation settings. Input selections,
geometry, model selection, and execution controls still come from the invocation.
Location runs never advance the normal latest pointer.

Location visualization inherits the cache ID recorded in the selected component
run. An explicit `--pc-xpass-id` or cache-directory override takes precedence.

## Existing caches and directory overrides

Existing unversioned caches remain in place and are not registered as latest.
Select them explicitly, for example:

```powershell
python scripts/run_hawkeye.py --pc-xpass --physical-cache-dir data/pc_xpass/hawkeye
python scripts/run_hawkeye_loc.py --pc-xpass-cache-dir data/pc_xpass/legacy_location
```

Do not combine an ID with a cache-directory override. Legacy metadata without
deceleration is interpreted as constant speed; location generation through that
explicit directory retains zero deceleration. No automatic migration occurs.
